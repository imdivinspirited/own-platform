   - Add DKIM records provided by Resend
   - Add DMARC record: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@ovaboe.dev`
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

   ```typescript
   from: 'ovaboe.dev <noreply@ovaboe.dev>'
   ```

### 2. Supabase Auth Email Hook

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates
2. Scroll to "Send Email Hook" section
